# Building on PromptG

PromptG is open for everyone: you can build tools, integrations, and services that use the PromptG format - no special permission required (see LICENSE).

## What You Can Build

Examples of what the community can build:

- IDE extensions
- CI/CD integrations
- Alternative CLI implementations
- Language-specific libraries (Python, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Pack marketplaces and repositories

All of these are permitted under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Using the PromptG Name

**Allowed - Compatibility statements:**

- "Supports PromptG format"
- "Import/export PromptG packs"
- "PromptG-compatible"
- "[YourTool] for PromptG"

**Not allowed - Implies official relationship:**

- "PromptG by [YourCompany]"
- "PromptG [ProductName]"
- Using PromptG logo as your primary branding

When in doubt, describe what your tool does ("prompt management platform that supports PromptG") rather than making it part of your product name.

## Official vs. Community Tools

- **Official tools:** Maintained by PromptG project (github.com/promptg/\*)
- **Community tools:** Built and maintained independently

Both are valuable. We encourage and celebrate community-built tools.
